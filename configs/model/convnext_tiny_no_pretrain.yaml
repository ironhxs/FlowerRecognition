# ConvNeXt Tiny - No Pretrained Weights (For Testing)
# Fast training for pipeline validation without network dependency

model:
  name: convnext_tiny
  architecture: convnext_tiny
  pretrained: false  # Disabled for testing
  num_classes: 100
  drop_path_rate: 0.1
  drop_rate: 0.0
  input_size: 256
  in_chans: 3
  use_compile: false

# Note: Without pretrained weights, accuracy will be lower
# Expected: ~60-70% (vs 85-88% with pretrained)
# Use this only for quick pipeline testing
